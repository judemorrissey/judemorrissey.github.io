Hello!

This is my endeavor with trying to make a static website hosted by Github. Hopefully this helps me polish up my skills with front end engineering.

To run a local webserver:
- first make sure you have this module installed `npm install http-server`
- then cd into your project directory, and run `http-server -c-1`
